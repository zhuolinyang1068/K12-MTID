K12-MTID: A Dataset for Teaching Intention Recognition in K-12 Multidisciplinary Classrooms
To provide a new perspective for teaching evaluation, we introduce K12-MTID, a large-scale dataset of teaching intention in real-world Kâ€“12 multidisciplinary classrooms. Grounded in teaching engagement theory, the dataset defines eight categories of teaching intention across three dimensions: emotion, cognition, and interaction.
In future work, we plan to incorporate speech information into the dataset to enable more precise recognition of teaching intention.
